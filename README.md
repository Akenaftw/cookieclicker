My first goal with JS is to create a nice looking cookieclicker. Wish me luck!

First 4 hours into this project were a lot of fun. JS has a lot of new terms and functions I hadn't
heard of but are really nice to experiment with. 
f.e. learned how to store cookies onto a web browser, so I can save someone's progress/details, etc...
This motivates me to learn JS because the possibilities and ways to utilise this language seem very cool.
So today I made the first clicker, an automated clicker upgrade and a way to save your progress before leaving the webpage.
Next up is adding different levels of clickers with each their own autoclicker upgrades!
