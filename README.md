My first goal with JS is to create a nice looking cookieclicker. Wish me luck!

First 4 hours into this project were a lot of fun. JS has a lot of new terms and functions I hadn't
heard of but are really nice to experiment with. 
f.e. learned how to store cookies onto a web browser, so I can save someone's progress/details, etc...
This motivates me to learn JS because the possibilities and ways to utilise this language seem very cool.
So today I made the first clicker, an automated clicker upgrade and a way to save your progress before leaving the webpage.
Next up is adding different levels of clickers with each their own autoclicker upgrades!

Second day went nice, added a second autoclicker level, and wrote a function to calculate the cookies per/s.
I liked the fact that even though this was mostly a copy paste of the last autoclicker level I made, it still 
was challenging and I had to continue to focus to do everything in the correct order so that the functions would work.
In the end I got a bit tired and had to search for an error in my code for the first time in JS,
this took ages to only then find out that i forgot to place 2 brackets at the end of a function name...
I am however glad that this happened because I really had to isolate every part of the code one by one to check them for errors,
and when in the end I got everything to work I could finally catch some sleep!

Debugged and reformed the document from titles with cookies to names more fitting of the context of my game.
I also added the 2 extra buttons for upgrades for the autoclickers. I had some issue getting my bearings in
the code again. But this is exactly why I like this side project, because I always have to go from start to
finish through the entire javascript to get into the workflow again, which makes for good repetition and challenges.
I am going to add a to do list on the bottom of the readme so you can see what I am planning on adding to this project in
the nearby future.

To do (ordered in prio from top to bottom):
- add remaining autoclickers for full course of Becode
- add upgrades for existing autoclickers
- add a styling to the page to make it look like the original cookie clicker layout wise
- add achievements for reaching a total amount of lines of code
- add achievements for reaching the field, the hill, the mountain and the summer pastures
- add random quote popups every so many clicks in a news overview window somewhere to add some comical value to the game.
- add fixed quotes popups for reaching certain skill levels in a language
- try to see how random generated events happen (rng bot/dice rolls)
