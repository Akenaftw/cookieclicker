My first goal with JS is to create a nice looking cookieclicker. Wish me luck!

First 4 hours into this project were a lot of fun. JS has a lot of new terms and functions I hadn't
heard of but are really nice to experiment with. 
f.e. learned how to store cookies onto a web browser, so I can save someone's progress/details, etc...
This motivates me to learn JS because the possibilities and ways to utilise this language seem very cool.
So today I made the first clicker, an automated clicker upgrade and a way to save your progress before leaving the webpage.
Next up is adding different levels of clickers with each their own autoclicker upgrades!

Second day went nice, added a second autoclicker level, and wrote a function to calculate the cookies per/s.
I liked the fact that even though this was mostly a copy paste of the last autoclicker level I made, it still 
was challenging and I had to continue to focus to do everything in the correct order so that the functions would work.
In the end I got a bit tired and had to search for an error in my code for the first time in JS,
this took ages to only then find out that i forgot to place 2 brackets at the end of a function name...
I am however glad that this happened because I really had to isolate every part of the code one by one to check them for errors,
and when in the end I got everything to work I could finally catch some sleep!
